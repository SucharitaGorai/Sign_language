This project focuses on designing and implementing an AI-powered sign language translator using a Raspberry Pi.
The primary goal of this system is to translate recognized sign language gestures into readable text or synthesized speech, enabling smoother, two-way 	communication between sign language users and non-signers.   
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how AI and embedded systems can  be combined to create practical solutions that address real-world social challenges.
